</head>

	<h1>A resolution has finally been reached in a case that disrupted the city and caused widespread protest and civil disobedience in all five boroughs. The city has agreed to pay Mitchell Green five million dollars in a no fault settlement that pays but accepts no reasonablity for the harm caused to Mr. Green. "I was given the choice of being legally vindicated with no money or taking the money and accepting that no one will ever be held resposible. It was a hard choice but vindication doesn't pay my bills." said Mr. Green. 
    
    Mr. Green plans to open an Artismal Butcher Shop with the settlement money. "People in our neighborhood have to go all the way downtown to get premium meat. I plan to bring downtown, uptown. People in my zip code will fall in love with Wagyu and Kobe Beef as well as $4,500 Jamon iberico" said an excited Mr. Green. We asked Mr. Green will members of the police force be welcomed in his butcher shop. To which he replied "Everyone is welcome unlike the the police we don't profile or discriminate." The name of Mr. Green's high end butcher shop will be called "No Justice, No Beef".</h1>
