	<h1>A few years ago Mitchell Green was left bloody on a Harlem street by over aggressive police officers. Today those officers are still in jail and Mitchell Green is running to represent in Congress the very same neighborhood where he was brutalized. When asked why he chose to run Mr. Green told a large crowd of supporters "I live here, my business is here and I almost died here. When I settled the 5 million dollar lawsuit I could've moved anywhere I pleased but I chose to stay in my neighborhood. I believe my love for this community makes me the best person to represent it" </h1>
